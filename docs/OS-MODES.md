## WHAT MAKES THIS THE KILLER FEATURE

### Why Modes > Individual Skills

| Individual Skills (OpenClaw) | Modes (Agentik OS) |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Install skills one by one | Get a complete system in 1 click |
| Configure each tool manually | Pre-configured, works together |
| No collaboration between skills | Agents collaborate across modes |
| Generic assistant | Domain-expert team |
| You build the workflow | Workflow built for you |
| "What can this do?" | "Everything for [domain]" |

### The Aha Moment

**OpenClaw:** "Here's an AI assistant. Figure out what to do with it."
**Agentik OS:** "Tell me what you do. Here's your AI team, ready to work."

That's the difference between a tool and an operating system.
