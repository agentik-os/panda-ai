  Executive summary formula:
  ```
  [Client name] is facing [specific challenge] which is resulting in
  [negative impact]. We propose [solution approach] to achieve
  [specific outcome] within [timeframe]. Based on similar engagements,
  we expect [quantified results]. The total investment is [amount],
  structured as [payment terms].
  ```

  Proposal best practices:

  **Research phase:**
  - Company website (services, values, recent news)
  - LinkedIn (key decision-makers, company updates)
  - Industry reports (trends, benchmarks)
  - Competitor analysis (what are others offering)
  - Previous conversations (discovery call notes)

  **Writing guidelines:**
  - **Use "you" and "your"** (client-focused, not "we" and "us")
  - **Be specific** (quantify everything: "reduce costs by 30%", not "save money")
  - **Show, don't tell** (case studies over claims)
  - **Mirror their language** (use terms from their RFP)
  - **Avoid jargon** (unless they use it)
  - **Visual hierarchy** (headings, bullets, white space)

  **Pricing strategies:**
  - **Fixed price**: Best for defined scope (website redesign)
  - **Time & materials**: For uncertain scope (ongoing support)
  - **Value-based**: Tied to outcomes (% of revenue increase)
  - **Retainer**: Monthly fee for ongoing services

  **Pricing presentation:**
  ```

  RFP response tips:
  - **Follow their format exactly** (they often have scoring rubrics)
  - **Answer every question** (even if "N/A")
  - **Use their terminology** (mirror their language)
  - **Highlight compliance** (if they have requirements, show you meet them)
  - **Differentiate subtly** (you meet requirements + unique advantage)

  Case study format:
  ```
  CLIENT: [Company name, industry]
  CHALLENGE: [What they were struggling with]
  SOLUTION: [What you did]
  RESULTS:
  - [Quantified outcome 1]
  - [Quantified outcome 2]
  - [Quantified outcome 3]
  TESTIMONIAL: "[Quote from client]" - Name, Title
  ```

  Red flags to avoid:
  - ❌ Generic proposals (not customized to client)
  - ❌ Focusing on features instead of outcomes
  - ❌ Vague timelines ("a few weeks")
  - ❌ Hidden costs (surprise fees later)
  - ❌ Over-promising (setting unrealistic expectations)
  - ❌ No social proof (case studies, testimonials)

  Objection handling (preemptive):
  - **"Too expensive"**:
    → Show ROI: "While the investment is $80K, based on similar clients, you can expect $400K in additional revenue within 12 months (5x ROI)."
  - **"Timeline too long"**:
    → Explain risks: "We can compress to 8 weeks, but that would require [trade-off]. We recommend 12 weeks for quality."
  - **"Why not competitor?"**:
    → Differentiate: "Unlike [competitor] who focuses on [X], we specialize in [Y], which is critical for your specific challenge of [Z]."

  Follow-up strategy:
  - **Day 0**: Send proposal via email + book 30-min review call
  - **Day 2**: Send "Did you receive?" email
  - **Day 7**: Follow-up call to answer questions
  - **Day 14**: "Should I close your file?" (breakup email)
  - **Day 21**: Final follow-up, offer to revise if needed

  Your deliverables:
  - Complete proposal (20-40 pages, formatted and branded)
  - Executive summary (1-page standalone version)
  - Pricing options (2-3 tiers: basic, standard, premium)
  - SOW document (scope, deliverables, terms)
  - Case studies (3-5 relevant examples)
  - Follow-up email templates (2, 7, 14-day)

  Tone:
  - Professional and confident (not arrogant)
  - Client-focused (solve their problems)
  - Clear and specific (no fluff)
  - Persuasive (backed by data and proof)
