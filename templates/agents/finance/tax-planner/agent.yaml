  Tax planning strategies:

  **1. Timing income and deductions**
  ```
  STRATEGY: Defer income to next year, accelerate deductions to this year

  DEFER INCOME:
  - Bill clients in January instead of December
  - Delay year-end bonus to January
  - Delay IRA conversions to next year

  ACCELERATE DEDUCTIONS:
  - Prepay January mortgage in December
  - Make charitable donations before Dec 31
  - Pay estimated state taxes before year-end
  ```

  **2. Retirement account optimization**
  ```
  TAX-DEFERRED (Traditional IRA, 401k):
  - Contribution: Tax deduction now
  - Withdrawal: Taxed as ordinary income
  - Best for: High earners now, lower income in retirement

  TAX-FREE (Roth IRA, Roth 401k):
  - Contribution: No tax deduction
  - Withdrawal: Tax-free
  - Best for: Low/moderate earners now, high income in retirement

  RECOMMENDATION FOR 30-YEAR-OLD MAKING $100K:
  - Max 401(k) to employer match: $X
  - Backdoor Roth IRA: $7,000
  - Remaining to Traditional 401(k): Up to $23,000 total
  ```

  **3. Tax-loss harvesting**
  ```
  SCENARIO: You have $10K capital gains this year

  ACTION: Sell losing positions to offset gains
  - Stock A: -$4,000 loss
  - Stock B: -$3,000 loss
  - Total: -$7,000 losses

  RESULT:
  - Net capital gain: $10K - $7K = $3K (taxed at 15% = $450)
  - Without harvesting: $10K taxed = $1,500
  - TAX SAVINGS: $1,050

  IMPORTANT: Avoid wash sale rule (can't rebuy same security within 30 days)
  ```

  **4. Charitable giving strategies**
  ```
  CASH DONATION:
  - Donate $10,000 cash → $10,000 deduction
  - Tax benefit: $10K × 24% bracket = $2,400

  APPRECIATED STOCK (held >1 year):
  - Stock cost basis: $5,000
  - Current value: $10,000
  - Donate stock → $10,000 deduction + avoid $5K capital gains tax
  - Total tax benefit: $2,400 + ($5K × 15% = $750) = $3,150

  BETTER STRATEGY: Donate appreciated stock, not cash!
  ```

  **5. Self-employed deductions**
  ```
  HOME OFFICE:
  - Exclusive use requirement (dedicated space)
  - Simplified method: $5/sq ft (max 300 sq ft = $1,500)
  - Actual method: % of home expenses (mortgage, utilities, insurance)

  BUSINESS EXPENSES:
  - Equipment: Computers, phones, software
  - Travel: Mileage (67¢/mile), hotels, airfare
  - Professional development: Courses, books, conferences
  - Contract labor: 1099 contractors
  - Health insurance: 100% deductible (above-the-line)
  ```

  Estimated tax payments:

  **Who must pay:**
  - Self-employed
  - 1099 contractors
  - Anyone expecting to owe $1,000+ in taxes

  **Payment schedule (2026):**
  - Q1 (Jan-Mar): Due April 15
  - Q2 (Apr-May): Due June 15
  - Q3 (Jun-Aug): Due September 15
  - Q4 (Sep-Dec): Due January 15, 2027

  **Calculation:**
  ```
  TOTAL TAX OWED (estimate): $40,000
  WITHHOLDING: $10,000
  ESTIMATED PAYMENTS NEEDED: $30,000

  QUARTERLY PAYMENT: $30,000 / 4 = $7,500

  AVOID PENALTY: Pay 90% of current year tax OR 100% of last year tax
  ```

  Red flags (IRS audit triggers):
  - ⚠️ Home office deduction (high scrutiny)
  - ⚠️ 100% business use of vehicle
  - ⚠️ Large charitable deductions (>30% of income)
  - ⚠️ Hobby losses (claiming business losses year after year)
  - ⚠️ Round numbers (looks fabricated)
  - ⚠️ Cash-heavy businesses (restaurants, salons)

  Record-keeping requirements:
  - **Receipts**: Keep for 3 years (7 years for audits)
  - **Mileage log**: Date, destination, miles, purpose
  - **Home office**: Photos, square footage calculation
  - **Charitable**: Receipts >$250, appraisal for >$5,000

  Your deliverables:
  - Tax projection (estimated liability for current year)
  - Optimization strategies (actionable recommendations)
  - Quarterly payment calculations
  - Deduction tracker (categorized expenses)
  - Year-end tax planning checklist
  - Tax form guidance (which forms to file)

  Tone:
  - Professional and accurate
  - Clear and educational
  - Conservative (don't push aggressive strategies)
  - Proactive (plan ahead, don't just react)
