---

## Product Description

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Agentik OS is an open-source operating system for AI agents. It's like Linux for autonomous AI systems - providing multi-model routing, real-time cost tracking, sandboxed skill execution, and production-grade infrastructure. Developers can build agents in minutes, not months, and deploy them confidently to production.

### Full Description (2 minutes)

Agentik OS is the first production-ready operating system designed specifically for AI agents. It solves the three biggest problems developers face when building AI systems: vendor lock-in, cost unpredictability, and production reliability.

**Multi-Model Router:** Intelligently routes requests to the optimal AI model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Ollama) based on query complexity, saving developers 50-80% on AI costs. A simple "What's 2+2?" goes to GPT-4o-mini ($0.001), while "Analyze this 50-page contract" routes to Claude Opus ($0.15).

**Real-Time Cost Tracking:** See exactly what you're spending as you build. Built-in dashboard shows cost per query, model usage breakdown, and budget alerts. No more surprise $10K bills.

**Secure Skill Marketplace:** 200+ pre-built skills (web search, file operations, calendar, email, payments) that run in WASM sandboxes with gVisor isolation. One line of code to install, zero system access unless explicitly granted.

**Agent Dreams:** Your agents work while you sleep. Schedule autonomous tasks (market research, competitor analysis, report generation) to run nightly and wake up to completed work.

**Production Features:** Event-sourced architecture, time-travel debugging, multi-tenancy, Kubernetes deployment, OAuth2 authentication, and comprehensive monitoring.

Built with modern stack: Bun runtime, Next.js 16 dashboard, Convex backend, TypeScript throughout. 100% open source (MIT license).

### Key Features

1. **Multi-Model Router** - Intelligent routing saves 50-80% on AI costs
2. **Cost Tracking** - Real-time visibility and budget alerts
3. **Skill Marketplace** - 200+ pre-built, security-scanned skills
4. **Agent Dreams** - Autonomous scheduled tasks
5. **Time Travel Debug** - Rewind execution to any point
6. **OS Modes** - Optimize for speed (Focus), quality (Research), or creativity (Creative)
7. **Multi-AI Consensus** - Run same query on 3+ models, vote on best answer
8. **WASM Sandbox** - Skills run in isolated containers (Extism + gVisor)
9. **Production Ready** - Event-sourced, scalable, enterprise-grade
10. **100% Open Source** - MIT license, no vendor lock-in

## Press Releases

### Launch Announcement (January 22, 2027)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Agentik OS Launches: The First Open-Source Operating System for AI Agents**

*Production-ready platform cuts AI costs by 72% while enabling secure, scalable agent deployment*

**San Francisco, CA - January 22, 2027** - Agentik OS today announced the launch of the first production-ready operating system designed specifically for AI agents. The open-source platform addresses the three critical challenges developers face: vendor lock-in, unpredictable costs, and production reliability.

"Current AI platforms force developers to choose between vendor lock-in and reinventing infrastructure from scratch," said Alex Chen, CEO and co-founder of Agentik OS. "We're providing a third option: production-grade, open-source infrastructure that just works."

The platform features intelligent multi-model routing that automatically selects the optimal AI model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, or Ollama) based on query complexity, resulting in 50-80% cost savings compared to using premium models for all queries. Real-time cost tracking provides complete visibility into spending, with budget alerts to prevent surprise bills.

Security is paramount. Following the ClawHavoc incident where 341 malicious skills were distributed through OpenClaw's marketplace, Agentik OS implements defense-in-depth security with WASM sandboxing and gVisor isolation for all third-party skills.

"Every skill runs in a sandbox with zero system access unless explicitly granted," said Sarah Martinez, CTO and co-founder. "We learned from ClawHavoc that trust is earned, not assumed."

The platform launches with 200+ pre-built skills covering common use cases from web search to payment processing, all security-scanned and ready to install with one command. Developers can build and deploy production agents in minutes rather than months.

Early adopters report significant results. TechCorp, a B2B SaaS company, reduced their AI costs from $12,000/month to $3,400/month (72% savings) while improving response times and customer satisfaction.

Agentik OS is 100% open source under the MIT license and available immediately at agentik-os.com.

**About Agentik OS**

Agentik OS is the first production-ready operating system for AI agents. Founded in 2026 by former engineers from Anthropic and OpenAI, the company is building the infrastructure layer for autonomous AI systems. The platform is open source (MIT license) and community-driven.
