# How We Saved $8.6K/Month with Multi-Model Routing

**Company**: TechCorp (B2B SaaS, 200 employees)
**Before**: $12,000/month on Claude Opus
**After**: $3,400/month (multi-model routing)
**Savings**: $8,600/month (72% reduction)

## The Problem

TechCorp runs a customer support AI agent that handles 10,000+ queries per day. Initially, they used **Claude Opus exclusively** because it gave the best answers.

But their AI bill was getting out of control:

```
Month 1: $8,500
Month 2: $10,200
Month 3: $12,000  ← "We need to do something"
```

### Why So Expensive?

They were using Claude Opus for **every query**, including:

- "What's your pricing?" ($0.15 per response)
- "How do I reset my password?" ($0.15 per response)
- "Where is your office?" ($0.15 per response)

**95% of queries were simple** and didn't need Opus-level intelligence.

## The Solution: Multi-Model Routing

We helped TechCorp implement Agentik OS's multi-model router. Here's how it works:

### 1. Query Classification

Every query is classified before routing:

```typescript
const complexity = await router.classify(query)

// Classification levels:
// - TRIVIAL: FAQ, greetings, simple questions
// - SIMPLE: Basic support, known procedures
// - COMPLEX: Technical debugging, custom solutions
// - CRITICAL: Legal, security, escalations
```

### 2. Smart Routing

Each level routes to the optimal model:

| Level | Model | Cost/Query | Use Cases |
|-------|-------|------------|-----------|
| **TRIVIAL** | GPT-4o-mini | $0.001 | "Hello", "Pricing?", "Hours?" |
| **SIMPLE** | GPT-4o | $0.01 | Password reset, basic troubleshooting |
| **COMPLEX** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $0.03 | Technical issues, integrations |
| **CRITICAL** | Claude Opus | $0.15 | Security, legal, escalations |

### 3. Automatic Fallback

If a "simple" query needs more intelligence, auto-upgrade:

```typescript
// User asks simple question
const response = await agent.chat("How do I export data?")
// Routed to GPT-4o ($0.01)

// Agent detects uncertainty
if (response.confidence < 0.8) {
  // Re-route to Sonnet ($0.03)
  const betterResponse = await agent.chat(query, { model: 'claude-sonnet' })
}
```

## Results

After 30 days of multi-model routing:

### Cost Breakdown

**Before (Opus only):**
```
10,000 queries/day × $0.15 = $1,500/day
$1,500 × 30 days = $45,000/month
  (They optimized to $12K through caching)
```

**After (Multi-model):**
```
Trivial (60%):  6,000 × $0.001 = $6/day
Simple (30%):   3,000 × $0.01  = $30/day
Complex (9%):     900 × $0.03  = $27/day
Critical (1%):    100 × $0.15  = $15/day

Total: $78/day × 30 = $2,340/month
  + Fallbacks & retries = $3,400/month
```

**Savings: $8,600/month (72%)**

### Quality Metrics

Did quality suffer? **No.**

| Metric | Before (Opus) | After (Multi-model) | Change |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| CSAT Score | 4.6/5 | 4.7/5 | +2% ✅ |
| Resolution Time | 45s | 42s | -7% ✅ |
| Escalation Rate | 8% | 7% | -12% ✅ |
| Accuracy | 94% | 95% | +1% ✅ |

**Quality actually improved** because:
1. Faster responses for simple queries (GPT-4o-mini is faster)
2. Opus reserved for complex issues (better focus)
3. Automatic fallback catches edge cases

## How We Did It

### Week 1: Baseline Measurement

Track current usage:

```bash
panda metrics cost --agent support --range last-30-days

Model Usage:
  Claude Opus: 100% (300,000 queries)

Top Queries (by cost):
  1. "What's your pricing?" - $450 (3,000 queries)
  2. "How do I reset password?" - $375 (2,500 queries)
  ...
```

**Finding**: 60% of queries cost <$0.01 in compute time but cost $0.15 each.

### Week 2: Enable Multi-Model Router

```typescript
// agent-config.yaml
routing:
  enabled: true
  strategy: cost-optimized
  models:
    trivial: gpt-4o-mini
    simple: gpt-4o
    complex: claude-sonnet-4-5
    critical: claude-opus

  classification:
    method: semantic
    threshold:
      trivial: 0.3
      simple: 0.6
      complex: 0.8
```

Enable in code:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  routing: 'cost-optimized',
  fallback: true,  // Auto-upgrade on low confidence
})
```

### Week 3: Monitor & Tune

Watch the dashboard:

```
Day 1:  $400 (split: 70% mini, 20% 4o, 10% Opus)
Day 7:  $350 (split: 75% mini, 18% 4o, 7% Opus)
Day 14: $320 (split: 80% mini, 15% 4o, 5% Opus)
```

Adjust thresholds:

```yaml
# Too many fallbacks? Raise thresholds
classification:
  threshold:
    trivial: 0.2  # More queries go to mini
    simple: 0.5
```

### Week 4: Production

Full rollout. Cost stabilized at **$3,400/month**.

## Advanced: Custom Routing Rules

TechCorp added custom rules for specific cases:

```typescript
// Always use Opus for enterprise customers
if (user.tier === 'enterprise') {
  router.forceModel('claude-opus')
}

// Use mini for FAQ keywords
if (query.includes('pricing') || query.includes('hours')) {
  router.forceModel('gpt-4o-mini')
}

// Technical issues → Sonnet
if (query.includes('API') || query.includes('integration')) {
  router.forceModel('claude-sonnet')
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Not All Queries Are Equal

Routing **"What's your pricing?"** to Opus is like using a Ferrari to buy groceries. It works, but it's wasteful.

### 2. Quality Doesn't Always Need Opus

GPT-4o-mini handles 80% of queries perfectly. Save Opus for the 10% that truly need it.

### 3. Cost Visibility is Critical

Without real-time tracking, you won't know which queries are expensive. Agentik OS's dashboard showed that:

- 5% of queries = 60% of costs
- Most expensive query: "Analyze this 500-line error log" ($4.50 each)

### 4. Automatic Fallback is Essential

Don't force users to manually retry with a better model. Auto-upgrade = better UX.

## ROI Calculator

Want to estimate your savings? Use this formula:

```
Current Cost = queries/day × $0.15 (Opus)

With Routing:
  Trivial (60%) = queries × 0.60 × $0.001 = A
  Simple (30%)  = queries × 0.30 × $0.01  = B
  Complex (9%)  = queries × 0.09 × $0.03  = C
  Critical (1%) = queries × 0.01 × $0.15  = D

New Cost = (A + B + C + D) × 30 days
Savings = Current Cost - New Cost
```

**Example** (10,000 queries/day):
```
Current: 10,000 × $0.15 × 30 = $45,000/month

With Routing:
  6,000 × $0.001 × 30 = $180
  3,000 × $0.01 × 30  = $900
    900 × $0.03 × 30  = $810
    100 × $0.15 × 30  = $450

New Cost: $2,340/month
Savings: $42,660/month (95%!)
```
