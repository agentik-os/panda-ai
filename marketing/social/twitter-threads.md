### Thread 2: Why We Built This

```
Why we built Agentik OS (instead of using OpenClaw):

We LOVE OpenClaw. Seriously.

But after using it in production for 6 months, we hit 3 critical problems:

1️⃣ Cost visibility
2️⃣ Multi-model support
3️⃣ Enterprise security

Let me explain: 🧵

(1/8)
---

PROBLEM #1: Cost Visibility

Our AI bill went from $2K → $12K/month.

We had no idea why.

Which agent was expensive? Which model? Which tasks?

OpenClaw doesn't track costs.

We needed to know where every dollar went.

So we built Cost X-Ray.

[Screenshot]

(2/8)
---

PROBLEM #2: Multi-Model Lock-In

We started with Claude.
Then wanted to try GPT-5.
Then Gemini for specific tasks.
Then Ollama for cost savings.

Switching models meant rewriting agents.

We needed ONE agent that could use ANY model.

So we built Multi-Model Router.

[Screenshot]

(3/8)
---

PROBLEM #3: Enterprise Security

Our security team had questions:

"How do you isolate agent execution?"
"What if an agent tries to access the network?"
"Can you audit every action?"
"Is this SOC 2 compliant?"

We couldn't answer "yes" to all of them.

So we built Security Sandbox.

[Screenshot]

(4/8)
---

Then we added MORE:

• Skill Marketplace (50+ pre-built skills)
• OS Modes (run anywhere)
• Real-time monitoring
• Team management
• Compliance reports

Every feature we wished OpenClaw had.

(5/8)
---

We're not saying OpenClaw is bad.

It's AMAZING. It inspired us.

But different teams have different needs.

If you need:
• Cost control
• Multi-model flexibility
• Enterprise security

Agentik OS might be better for you.

### Thread 3: Cost X-Ray Deep Dive

```
We spent $47,392 on AI agents last month.

Here's the EXACT breakdown (and how we cut it by 62%):

A thread on AI cost optimization 🧵

(1/12)
---

BEFORE Cost X-Ray:

Total monthly bill: $47,392
Per-agent breakdown: Unknown
Cost per task: Unknown
Model efficiency: Unknown

We were flying blind.

[Screenshot of invoice]

(2/12)

AFTER implementing Agentik OS Cost X-Ray:

Discovered:
• 3 agents cost $28K (59% of total)
• 1 agent made 400K API calls (mostly errors)
• GPT-4 was used for simple tasks
• Weekend jobs ran unnecessarily

WTF.

[Screenshot of Cost X-Ray dashboard]

(3/12)
---

FIX #1: Route simple tasks to cheaper models

Before: GPT-4 for everything
After: Haiku for simple, Sonnet for complex, Opus for critical

Result: -32% costs
Savings: $15,165/month

[Screenshot of model routing rules]

(4/12)
---

FIX #2: Fixed the agent with 400K errors

It was stuck in a retry loop.
Every failure → 10 retries.
Each retry cost $0.03.

Fix took 20 minutes.

Result: -18% costs
Savings: $8,530/month

[Screenshot of error logs]

(5/12)
---

FIX #3: Disabled weekend jobs

Nobody reads reports on Saturday.
But agents kept generating them.

Added schedule rules:
Mon-Fri only, 9am-6pm.

Result: -8% costs
Savings: $3,791/month

[Screenshot of schedule settings]

(6/12)
---

FIX #4: Set budget alerts

Created alerts:
• Daily > $2K
• Per-agent > $500/day
• Model usage > 100K tokens/hour

Caught 4 runaway agents in first week.

Result: -4% costs
Savings: $1,896/month

[Screenshot of alerts]

(7/12)
---

TOTAL IMPACT:

Before: $47,392/month
After: $18,010/month

Savings: $29,382/month (62% reduction)
Annual savings: $352,584

Same functionality. Same quality.
Just smarter routing.

HOW COST X-RAY WORKS:

1. Tracks every API call
2. Calculates cost per model/agent/task
3. Shows trends over time
4. Alerts on anomalies
5. Suggests optimizations

All in real-time.

[Architecture diagram]

(9/12)
---

BONUS: Cost optimization tips

1. Use cheapest model that works
2. Cache common responses
3. Batch similar requests
4. Set per-agent budgets
5. Monitor error rates
6. Schedule non-urgent tasks
7. Use streaming for long responses

[Screenshot of tips panel]

(10/12)

This is why we built Agentik OS.

You can't optimize what you can't measure.

Cost X-Ray gives you total visibility.

Then you can make smart decisions.

### Thread 4: Multi-Model Router

```
We use 4 different AI models in production:

• Claude Opus
• GPT-5
• Gemini
• Ollama

Same agent. No code changes.

Here's how (and why): 🧵

(1/9)
---

THE PROBLEM:

Different models are good at different things:

• Claude: Reasoning, code
• GPT-5: Conversation, creativity
• Gemini: Multimodal, fast
• Ollama: Cost-effective, private

Using only ONE model = suboptimal.

(2/9)
---

OUR SOLUTION: Multi-Model Router

ONE agent config:
```yaml
routing:
  default: claude-sonnet
  rules:
    - if: task.type == "code_review"
      use: claude-opus
    - if: task.tokens > 100000
      use: gemini-pro
    - if: task.sensitive == true
      use: ollama
```

The router picks the best model automatically.

(3/9)
---

ROUTING STRATEGIES:

1. **Task-based**: Code review → Claude, chat → GPT
2. **Cost-based**: Budget tight → Ollama, urgent → Opus
3. **Performance-based**: Fast response → Gemini, deep thinking → Claude
4. **Failover**: Primary down → fallback model

All configurable.

[Screenshot of routing dashboard]

(4/9)
---

REAL EXAMPLE: Content Moderation Agent

```typescript
// Before: GPT-4 only ($$$)
// After: Smart routing

Rules:
- Simple check (profanity) → Haiku ($)
- Complex check (context) → Sonnet ($$)
- Appeal review → Opus ($$$)

Cost: -68%
Accuracy: Same
Speed: +40%
```

[Screenshot of results]

(5/9)
---

AUTOMATIC FAILOVER:

```yaml
models:
  primary: claude-opus
  fallback:
    - claude-sonnet
    - gpt-4
    - gemini-pro

failover:
  on_error: true
  on_rate_limit: true
  on_timeout: true
```

Never down. Always working.

[Diagram of failover flow]

(6/9)
---

COST COMPARISON:

Using ONLY Claude Opus:
$12,000/month

Using Multi-Model Router:
- 60% Haiku: $2,160
- 30% Sonnet: $2,700
- 10% Opus: $1,200
Total: $6,060/month

Same quality. 50% savings.

[Cost breakdown chart]

(7/9)
---

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Agent sends request
2. Router analyzes task
3. Selects best model
4. Handles API call
5. Returns result
6. Logs metrics

Transparent to agent code.
No changes needed.

[Architecture diagram]

(8/9)

This is why we built Agentik OS.

One platform. Any model. Best results.

No vendor lock-in.
Just optimal routing.

### Thread 5: Security Sandbox

```
Every AI agent is a security risk.

They run code. Access APIs. Read data.

What if they:
• Leak secrets?
• Access network?
• Read sensitive files?
• Execute malicious code?

Here's how we sandboxed them: 🧵

(1/10)
---

THREAT MODEL:

AI agents can:
✅ Execute arbitrary code
✅ Make network requests
✅ Read/write files
✅ Access environment variables

If compromised, they can:
❌ Steal secrets
❌ Exfiltrate data
❌ Attack infrastructure

We needed defense in depth.

(2/10)
---

LAYER 1: WASM Execution

All user code runs in WebAssembly:
• Memory isolated
• No direct syscalls
• Deterministic execution
• Sandboxed by default

Using Extism:
```rust
let agent = Agent::new("agent.wasm");
agent.run_isolated();
```

[Diagram of WASM isolation]

(3/10)
---

LAYER 2: gVisor Containers

Even WASM runs in gVisor:
• User-space kernel
• Syscall interception
• Resource limits
• Network isolation

If WASM escapes → still contained.

[Architecture diagram]

(4/10)
---

LAYER 3: Network Controls

Default: **No network access**

Explicit allowlist:
```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - "api.openai.com"
    - "api.anthropic.com"
  blocked:
    - "10.0.0.0/8"  # Internal network
    - "192.168.0.0/16"
```

Least privilege by default.

[Screenshot of network rules]

(5/10)
---

LAYER 4: File System Isolation

Agents can only access:
• Their own directory
• Explicitly mounted volumes

```yaml
filesystem:
  readonly:
    - /app/config
  readwrite:
    - /tmp/agent-123
  denied:
    - /etc
    - /home
```

[Diagram of filesystem permissions]

(6/10)
---

LAYER 5: Capability-Based Security

Agents request capabilities:
```typescript
agent.request([
  "network:openai",
  "filesystem:temp",
  "secrets:read",
])
```

Admin approves/denies.
Zero trust model.

[Screenshot of capability requests]

(7/10)
---

LAYER 6: Audit Logs

Every action logged:
• API calls
• File access
• Network requests
• Secret usage
• Resource consumption

Immutable. Tamper-proof.
SOC 2 compliant.

[Screenshot of audit log]

(8/10)
---

REAL INCIDENT:

Agent tried to:
1. Read `/etc/passwd`
2. Access internal API
3. Exfiltrate to external server

ALL BLOCKED by sandbox.

Alerts triggered immediately.
Agent paused automatically.

Security team notified.

[Screenshot of security alert]

(9/10)
---

This is production-grade security.

Not an afterthought. Core feature.

Zero trust. Defense in depth.
Sleep soundly.
