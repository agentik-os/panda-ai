## Script

### Scene 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:40)

**[Screen: Multiple browser tabs showing OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI dashboards]**

**Voiceover:**
> "You're building AI agents. Maybe for customer support, maybe for code review, maybe for data analysis. And you're probably facing these problems:"

**[Animation: Text appears one by one]**
- "Where's all my money going?" (AI bill: $47,000/month)
- "What if OpenAI goes down?" (Red X over OpenAI logo)
- "How do I ship this to production?" (Security warning icon)

**Voiceover:**
> "Sound familiar? You're not alone. This is the AI infrastructure problem. And we built Agentik OS to solve it."

---

### Scene 2: What is Agentik OS? (0:40 - 1:20)

**[Screen: Agentik OS dashboard - clean, modern UI]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Agentik OS is an AI Agent Operating System. Think of it as the Linux for AI agents. It gives you:"

**[Animation: Three core features animate in]**

**1. Cost X-Ray**
**[Screen: Cost breakdown dashboard showing agent-by-agent costs]**
> "Total cost visibility. Know exactly what each agent costs, which model it's using, and where your budget goes. No more surprise bills."

**2. Multi-Model Router**
**[Screen: Architecture diagram showing Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, Ollama]**
> "No vendor lock-in. Use Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, Ollama - or all of them. Automatic failover. Cost-optimized routing. One API."

**3. Security Sandbox**
**[Screen: WASM sandbox visualization with network isolation]**
> "Enterprise-grade security. WASM isolation, network policies, audit logs. SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA compliant out of the box."

---

### Scene 3: How It Works (1:20 - 2:10)

**[Screen: Terminal - showing agent creation]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's how you use it. Create an agent in 30 seconds:"

**[Terminal commands appear as typed]**

```bash
# Create an agent
agentik init customer-support

# Configure multi-model routing
agentik config set model auto

# Deploy
agentik deploy --mode production
```

**[Screen switches to Agentik OS dashboard]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Now watch what happens. Your agent automatically:"

**[Dashboard animations showing real-time data]**
- "Routes requests to the cheapest model that can handle it"
- "Fails over to Claude if OpenAI is down"
- "Logs everything for compliance"
- "Tracks costs in real-time"

**Voiceover:**
> "And you? You just write your agent logic. Agentik OS handles the infrastructure."

---

### Scene 4: Real Results (2:10 - 2:40)

**[Screen: Case study metrics appearing one by one]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Companies using Agentik OS are seeing real results:"

**[Metrics animate in with icons]**

**SaaS Company**
- 68% cost reduction
- $32,000 → $10,000/month

**E-commerce Store**
- 73% support automation
- 4 hours → 12 minutes response time

**Dev Team**
- 3x faster shipping
- 87% fewer bugs in production

**[Text overlay: "100% open source. Production-ready. Enterprise-grade."]**

---

### Scene 5: Call to Action (2:40 - 3:00)

**[Screen: GitHub repo page with star button prominently displayed]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Agentik OS is 100% open source. Install it in 5 minutes. Build your first agent in 10."

**[Screen: Quick install command]**

```bash
npm install -g agentik
agentik init my-first-agent
```

**[Screen: Call to action overlays]**
- **GitHub:** github.com/agentik-os/agentik-os
- **Docs:** docs.agentik-os.com
- **Discord:** discord.gg/agentikos
