## Comment Response Templates

### General Interest
```
Thanks [Name]! 🙏

[Answer their specific question]

Feel free to star us on GitHub: https://github.com/agentik-os/agentik-os

Happy to answer any other questions!
```

### Technical Questions
```
Great question, [Name]!

[Detailed technical answer with code examples]

You can see the full implementation here: [link to docs/code]

Let me know if you need more details!
```

### Comparison Questions (vs OpenClaw, etc.)
```
Good question! Here's how we compare:

Agentik OS:
- ✅ Multi-model (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- ✅ Cost transparency
- ✅ Beautiful modern UI
- ✅ Enterprise features (RBAC, SSO)

OpenClaw:
- ❌ Claude-only
- ⚠️ Basic cost tracking
- ⚠️ Older UI
- ⚠️ Limited enterprise features

We respect OpenClaw (191K stars!) but built something that goes further. Both are great for different use cases.
```

### Feature Requests
```
Love this idea, [Name]! 🚀

I've added it to our roadmap: [GitHub issue link]

Would you be interested in beta testing when we build it?
