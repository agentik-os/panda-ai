### Headline
"Agentik OS - The AI Agent Operating System"

### Description
"Self-hosted multi-model AI agent platform with intelligent routing, real-time collaboration, and enterprise security. Built to surpass OpenClaw with superior UX and cost transparency."

### First Comment (Hunter's Comment)

```
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [Your Name], and I built Agentik OS with a team of AI agents using FORGE v5.1.

**The Problem:**
OpenClaw has 191K stars but locks you into Claude. Most AI platforms force vendor lock-in, hide costs, and lack enterprise features.

**Our Solution:**
Agentik OS is a self-hosted AI agent platform with:
- 🧠 Multi-model routing (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, Ollama)
- 💰 X-Ray cost tracking (see exact $ per message)
- 💎 Beautiful Next.js dashboard
- 🔒 Enterprise-grade security (WASM sandboxing)
- 🌐 500+ MCP tools from the ecosystem
- 🚀 10 OS Modes (Focus, Research, Build, etc.)

**Tech Stack:**
- Turborepo monorepo
- Next.js 16 + shadcn/ui
- Convex real-time backend
- TypeScript strict mode
- 308 passing tests

**Try it:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentik-os/agentik-os
pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm --filter @agentik-os/cli exec panda init
```

**Goal:** 100K GitHub stars in 12 months 🎯

Questions? I'll be here all day answering!
